# File Menu Template Asterisk Version

J.C.R Soft~Choice File Menu Python program example:

Created by Joseph C. Richardson, GitHub.com

You will need to import your own files to correctly make this Python
file menu program example work. You can also use some of my program
examples to create a working Python file menu of your very own.
I created this file menu and its files associated with it, using def
functions(). This Python file menu example shows how to create modules and
how to import them into your very own file menu. Note: you must store
all your files within the very same folder you create your file menu in.
If you don't do such, the file menu won't be able to find the files you
want in your file menu. See my file menu folder image below. Also note
the little yellow folder you see at the very top makes itself. You must
leave this folder where it is and don't play with the files inside it. These
are binary files for the links to the files in your file menu Python program
example.
